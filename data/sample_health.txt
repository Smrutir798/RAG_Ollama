# The Common Cold
The common cold is a viral infection of your nose and throat (upper respiratory tract). It's usually harmless, although it might not feel that way. Many types of viruses can cause a common cold.
Symptoms:
- Runny or stuffy nose
- Sore throat
- Cough
- Congestion
- Slight body aches or a mild headache
- Sneezing
- Low-grade fever
- Generally feeling unwell (malaise)

Treatment:
There's no cure for the common cold. Antibiotics are of no use against cold viruses and shouldn't be used unless there's a bacterial infection. Treatment is directed at relieving signs and symptoms.
- Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or mild NSAIDs.
- Decongestant nasal sprays.
- Cough syrups.

# Influenza (Flu)
Influenza is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs. Influenza is commonly called the flu, but it's not the same as stomach "flu" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.
Symptoms:
- Fever over 100.4 F (38 C)
- Aching muscles
- Chills and sweats
- Headache
- Dry, persistent cough
- Fatigue and weakness
- Nasal congestion
- Sore throat

Treatment:
Usually, you'll need nothing more than bed rest and plenty of fluids to treat the flu. But if you have a severe infection or are at higher risk for complications, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral drug, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu), baloxavir (Xofluza), zanamivir (Relenza) or peramivir (Rapivab).
